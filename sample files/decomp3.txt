1.1 Introduction
Vector algebra1 is the algebra of vectors: a set of mathematical rules that allows meaningful and useful operations in the
study of electromagnetics. We will define vectors and the necessary operations shortly, but, for now, it is useful to remember
the following axiom which will be followed throughout this book: Nothing will be defined, no quantity or operation will be
used, unless it has some utility either in explaining the observed physical quantities or otherwise simplifies the discussion of
a topic. This is important because, as we increase our understanding of the subject, topics may seem to be disconnected,
particularly in this and the following chapter. The discussion of vector algebra and vector calculus will be developed
separately from the ideas of the electromagnetic field but for the purpose of describing the electromagnetic field. It is also
implicit in this statement that by doing so, we should be able to simplify the discussion of electromagnetics and, necessarily,
better understand the physical properties of fields.
Vector algebra is a set of rules that apply to vector quantities. In this sense, it is similar to the algebra we are all familiar
with (which we may call scalar algebra): it has rules, the rules are defined and then followed, and the rules are self-consistent.
Because at this point we know little about electromagnetics, the examples given here will be taken from other areas:
mechanics, elementary physics, and, in particular, from everyday experience. Any reference to electric or magnetic
quantities will be in terms of circuit theory or generally known quantities. The principle is not to introduce quantities and
relations that we do not fully understand. It sometimes comes as a surprise to find that many of the quantities involved in
electromagnetics are familiar, even though we may have never thought of them in this sense. All that the rules of vector
algebra do is to formalize these rather loose bits of information and define their interactions. At that point, we will be able to
use them in a meaningful way to describe the behavior of fields in exact terms using a concise notation.
It is worth mentioning that vector algebra (and vector calculus, which will be discussed in the following chapter) contains
a very small number of quantities and operations. For this reason, the vector notation is extremely compact. There are only
two quantities required: scalars and vectors. Four basic operations are required for vectors: addition, vector scaling, scalar
product, and vector product.
1 Vector analysis, of which vector algebra is a subset, was developed simultaneously and independently by Josiah Willard Gibbs (1839–1903) and
Oliver Heaviside (1850–1924) around 1881, for the expressed purpose of describing electromagnetics. The notation used throughout is more or
less that of Heaviside. Vector analysis did not gain immediate acceptance. It was considered to be “useless” by Lord Kelvin, and many others
thought of it as “awfully difficult,” as Heaviside himself mentions in his introduction to vector algebra. Nevertheless, by the end of the nineteenth
century, it was in general use.

In addition, we will define distributions of vectors and scalars in space as vector and scalar fields and will introduce the
commonly used coordinate systems. The discussion in this chapter starts with the definition of scalars and vectors in
Cartesian coordinates. The latter is assumed to be known and is used exclusively in the first few sections, until cylindrical
and spherical coordinates are defined.
1.2 Scalars and Vectors
A quantity is a scalar if it has only a magnitude at any location in space for a given time. To describe the mass of a body, all
we need is the magnitude of its mass or, for a distributed mass, the distribution in space. The same applies to the altitude of a
mountain or the length of a road. These are all scalar quantities and, in particular, are static scalar quantities (independent of
time). In terms of quantities useful in the study of electromagnetics, we also encounter other scalars such as work, energy,
time, temperature, and electric potential (voltage). Scalar sources also play an important role: The electric charge or charge
distribution (for example, charge distributed in a cloud) will be seen as sources of fields. The source of a 1.5 V cell is its
potential and is a scalar source.
A vector, on the other hand, is described by two quantities: a magnitude and a direction in space at any point and for any
given time. Therefore, vectors may be space and time dependent. Common vectors include displacement, velocity, force,
and acceleration. To see that the vector definition is important, consider a weather report giving wind speeds. The speed
itself is only part of the information. If you are sailing, direction of the wind is also important. For a pilot, it is extremely
important to know if the wind also has a downward component (shear wind), which may affect the flight plan. Sometimes,
only the magnitude may be important: The electric generating capability of a wind-driven turbine is directly proportional to
the normal (perpendicular to the turbine blades) component of the wind. Other times we may only be interested in direction.
For example, the news report may say: “The rocket took off straight up.” Here, the direction is the important information,
and although both direction and magnitude are available, for one reason or another, the liftoff speed or acceleration is not
important in this statement. The unit associated with a quantity is not part of the vector notation.
The use of vectors in electromagnetics is based on two properties of the vector. One is its ability to describe both
magnitude and direction. The second is its very compact form, which allows the description of quantities with great economy
in notation. This economy in notation eases handling of otherwise awkward expressions but also requires familiarity with the
implications of the notation. In a way, it is like shorthand. A compact notation is used, but it also requires us to know how to
read it so that the information conveyed is meaningful and unambiguous.
To allow instant recognition of a vector quantity, we denote vectors by a boldface letter such as E, H, a, and b. Scalar
quantities are denoted by regular letters: E, H, a, and b. In handwriting, it is difficult to make the distinction between normal
and boldface lettering. A common method is to use a bar or arrow over the letter to indicate a vector. Thus,E, H, a, b, are also
vectors. If a quantity is used only as a vector, there is no need to distinguish it from the corresponding scalar quantity. Some
vector operators (which will be discussed in the following chapter) are of this type. In these instances, neither boldface nor
bar notation is needed since there is no room for confusion.
1.2.1 Magnitude and Direction of Vectors: The Unit Vector and Components of a Vector
The magnitude of a vector is that scalar which is numerically equal to the vector:
A ¼ j j A ð1:1Þ
The magnitude of a vector is its length and includes the units of the vector. Thus, for example, the magnitude of a velocity
vector v is the speed v [m/s]. To define the direction of a vector A, we employ the idea of the unit vector. A unit vector Aˆ is a
vector of magnitude one (dimensionless) in the direction of A:
A^ ¼ A
j j A ¼ A
A ð1:2Þ
2 1 Vector Algebra
Thus, Aˆ can be viewed as a new dimensionless vector of unit magnitude (jAˆ j ¼ 1) in the direction of, or parallel to, the
vector A. Figure 1.1 shows a vector, its magnitude, and its unit vector.
Vectors may have components in various directions. For example, a vehicle moving at a velocity v on a road that runs SE
to NW has two equal velocity components, one in the N direction and one in the W direction, as shown in Figure 1.2a. We
can write the velocity of the vehicle in terms of two velocity components as
v ¼ N^ vN þ W^ vW ¼ N^ v
ffiffiffi

The two terms on the right-hand side (N^ v ffiffiffi
2
p =2 and W^ v ffiffiffi
2
p =2) are called the vector components of the vector. The
components of the vectors can also be viewed as scalars by taking only their magnitude. These are called scalar components.
This definition is used extensively when standard systems of coordinates are used and the directions in space are known. In
this case, the scalar components are v ffiffiffi
2
p =2 in the N and W directions. To avoid confusion as to which type of component is
used, we will always indicate specifically the type of component unless it is obvious which type is meant.
We chose here a particular system of coordinates to demonstrate that the system of coordinates is a matter of choice. The
same can be accomplished by laying a standard system of coordinates, say the rectangular coordinate system over the road
map shown in Figure 1.2a. This action transforms the road map into a standard coordinate system, and now, using
Figure 1.2b, we can write
v ¼ ^x vx þ ^y vy ¼ ^x v

1.2 Scalars and Vectors 3
It is important to note that although the unit vector ^v has unit magnitude, its components in the x and y directions do not.
Their magnitude is ffiffiffi
2
p =2. This may seem to be a minor distinction, but, in fact, it is important to realize that the vector
components of a unit vector are not necessarily of unit magnitude. Note, also, that the magnitude of ^x and ^y is one since these
are the unit vectors in the direction of the vector components of v, namely, x and y.
In this case, both the vector and the unit vector were conveniently written in terms of a particular coordinate system.
However, as a rule, any vector can be written in terms of components in other coordinate systems. An example is the one
used to describe directions as N, S, W, and E. We shall discuss this separately, but from the above example, some systems are
clearly more convenient than others. Also to be noted here is that a general vector in space written in the Cartesian system
has three components, in the x, y, and z directions (see below). The third dimension in the above example of velocity gives
the vertical component of velocity as the vehicle moves on a nonplanar surface.
In the right-handed Cartesian system (or right-handed rectangular system), we define three coordinates as shown
in Figure 1.3. A point in the system is described as P(x0,y0,z0), and the general vector A, connecting two general points
P1(x1,y1,z1) and P2(x2,y2,z2), is given as
Að Þ¼ x; y;z ^x Axð Þþ x; y;z ^y Ayð Þþ x; y;z ^z AzðÞ ð x; y;z 1:7Þ
where the scalar components Ax, Ay, and Az are the projections of the vector on the x, y, and z coordinates, respectively. These
are
Ax ¼ x2  x1, Ay ¼ y2  y1, Az ¼ z2  z1 ð1:8Þ

Example 1.1 A vector is given as A ¼ ^x 5  ^y ð Þþ 3x þ 2 ^z . Calculate:
(a) The scalar components of the vector in the x, y, and z directions.
(b) The length of the vector.
(c) The unit vector in the direction of A.
Solution: The solution makes use of Eqs. (1.8) through (1.11). In this case, the vector (and all its properties) depends on the
variable x alone, although it has components in the y and z directions:
(a) The scalar components of the vector are the coefficients of the three unit vectors:
Ax ¼ 5, Ay ¼ ð Þ 3x þ 2 , Az ¼ 1
Note: The negative sign is part of the scalar component, not the unit vector.

Example 1.2 An aircraft takes off at a 60 angle and takeoff speed of 180 km/h in the NE–SW direction. Find:
(a) The velocity vector of the aircraft.
(b) Its direction in space.
(c) Its ground velocity (i.e., the velocity of the aircraft’s shadow on the ground).
Solution: First, we choose a system of coordinates. In this case, E–W, N–S, and D (down)–U (up) is an appropriate choice.
This choice describes the physics of the problem even though it is not the most efficient system we can use. (In the exercise
that follows, the Cartesian system is used instead.) The components of velocity are calculated from the magnitude
(180 km/h) of velocity and angle using projections on the ground and vertically, followed by the velocity vector and the
unit vector:
(a) The aircraft velocity has two scalar components: the vertical component vu ¼ 180sin60 and the ground component
vg ¼ 180cos60. These speeds are given in km/h. The SI units call for the second as the unit of time and the meter as
the unit of distance. Thus, we convert these speeds to m/s. Since 180 km/h ¼ 50 m/s, we get vg ¼ 50cos60 and
vu ¼ 50sin60. The west and south components are calculated from vg, as (see Figure 1.4)

1.2.2 Vector Addition and Subtraction Point_Charges.m
The first vector algebra operation that needs to be defined is vector addition. This is perhaps the most commonly performed
vector operation.
The sum of two vectors results in a third vector
A þ B ¼ C ð1:12Þ
To see how this operation is carried out, we use two general vectors A ¼ ^x Ax þ ^y Ay þ ^z Az and B ¼ ^x Bx þ ^y By þ ^z Bz

Adding components in the same directions together gives

Figure 1.5 shows this process: In Figure 1.5a, vectors A and B are separated into their three components. Figure 1.5b
shows that vector C is obtained by adding the components of A and B, which, in turn, are equivalent to translating the vector
B (without changing its direction in space or its magnitude) so that its tail coincides with the head of vector A. Vector C is
now the vector connecting the tail of vector A with the head of vector B. This sketch defines a general graphical method of
calculating the sum of two vectors:
(1) Draw the first vector in the sum.
(2) Translate the second vector until the tail of the second vector coincides with the head of the first vector.
(3) Connect the tail of the first vector with the head of the second vector to obtain the sum.
The process is shown in Figure 1.6 in general terms. This method of calculating the sum of two vectors is sometimes
called the head-to-tail method or rule. An alternative method is obtained by generating two sums A + B and B + A using the
above method. The two sums are shown in Figure 1.7a as two separate vectors and as a single vector in Figure 1.7b. The
result is a parallelogram with the two vectors, connected tail to tail forming two adjacent sides, and the remaining two sides
are parallel lines to the vectors. This method is summarized as follows:
(1) Translate vector B so that its tail coincides with the tail of vector A.
(2) Construct the parallelogram formed by the two vectors and the two parallels to the vectors.
(3) Draw vector C with its tail at the tails of vectors A and B and head at the intersection of the two parallel lines (dashed
lines in Figure 1.8).
This method is shown in Figure 1.8 and is called the parallelogram rule.

1.2 Scalars and Vectors 7
Vector subtraction is accomplished by noting the following:
A  B ¼ A þ ð Þ¼ B A^ A þ B^   B ð1:15Þ
This indicates that vector subtraction is the same as the addition of a negative vector. In terms of the tail-to-head or
parallelogram method, we must first reverse the direction of vector B and then perform summation of the two vectors. This is
shown in Figure 1.9.
Summation or subtraction of more than two vectors should be viewed as a multiple-step process. For example:
A þ B þ C ¼ ð Þþ A þ B C ¼ D þ C ð1:16Þ
The sum D ¼ A + B is calculated first using the above methods and then the sum D + C is evaluated similarly. The same
applies to subtraction.
Note: Any of the two graphical methods of calculating the sum of two vectors may be used, but, in computation, it is often
more convenient to separate the vectors into their components and calculate the sum of the components. This is particularly
true if we also need to calculate unit vectors. The graphical methods are more useful in understanding what the sum of the
vector means and to visualize the direction in space.
Vector summation and subtraction are associative and commutative processes; that is:
A þ B ¼ B þ A ðÞ ð commutative 1:17Þ
ð Þþ A þ B C ¼ A þ ð Þ B þ C ðÞ ð associative 1:18Þ
The vector addition is also distributive, but we will only show this in Section 1.2.3.
Example 1.3 Two vectors A and B (such as the velocity vectors of two aircraft) are A ¼ ^x 1 þ ^y 2 þ ^z 3 and
B ¼ ^x 4  ^z 3. Calculate:
(a) The sum of the two vectors.
(b) The difference A – B and B – A (these differences represent the relative velocities of A with respect to B and of B
with respect to A).
Solution: (a) The vectors are placed on the system of coordinates shown in Figure 1.10a, and the components of A and B
are found as shown. The components of vector C ¼ A + B are now found directly from the figure. In (b), we write the two
expressions D ¼ A – B and E ¼ B – A and add together the components:
(a) Vector A has scalar components of 1, 2, and 3 in the x, y, and z directions, respectively. It may therefore be viewed as
connecting the origin (as a reference point) to point P1(1,2,3), as shown in Figure 1.10a. Vector B is in the x–z plane

and connects the origin to point P2(4,0,–3). The vectors may be translated anywhere in space as long as their lengths and
directions are not changed. Translate vector A such that its tail touches the head of vector B. This is shown in
Figure 1.10b in terms of the components (i.e., translation of vector A so that its tail coincides with the head of vector
B is the same as translating its components so that their tails coincide with the heads of the corresponding components of
vector B). The sum C ¼ A + B is the vector connecting the tail of vector B with the head of vector A. The result is
(writing the projections of vector C onto the x, y, and z axes):
C ¼ ^x 5 þ ^y 2

1.2.3 Vector Scaling
A vector can be scaled by multiplying its magnitude by a scalar value. Scaling is defined as changing the magnitude of the
vector:
kA ¼ k A^ A
 	 ¼ A^ ðÞ ð kA 1:19Þ
The term “multiplication” for vectors is not used to avoid any confusion with vector products, which we define in the
following section. Scaling of a vector is equivalent to “lengthening” or “shortening” the vector without modifying its
direction if k is a positive constant, as shown in Figure 1.11a. Increasing the velocity of an aircraft (without change in
direction) from 300 to 330 km/h scales the velocity vector by a factor of k ¼ 1.1. If k is negative, the resulting scaled vector
has a magnitude jkj times its nonscaled magnitude but also a negative direction, as shown in Figure 1.11b.
Vector scaling is both associative and commutative but not distributive (simply because the product of two vectors has

Also,

The latter shows that the vector sum is distributive.
1.3 Products of Vectors
The multiplication of two vectors is called a product. Here, we define two types of products based on the result obtained
from the product. The first type is the scalar product. This is a product of two vectors which results in a scalar. The second is a
vector product of two vectors, which results in a vector. Beyond the form of the product, these have important physical and
geometrical meanings which make them some of the most useful and often encountered vector operations.
1.3.1 The Scalar Product
A scalar product of two vectors A and B is denoted as A·B and is defined as
“the product of the magnitudes of A and B and the cosine of the smaller angle between A and B”; that is,
AB   ABcosϕAB ð1:23Þ
A
a b
kA
A −kA
Figure 1.11 (a) Scaling of vector A by a positive scalar k. (b) Scaling of vector A by a negative scalar k
10 1 Vector Algebra
where the angle ϕAB is the smaller angle between A and B, as shown in Figure 1.12. The sign   indicates that Eq. (1.23) is
the definition of the scalar product. The result is a scalar. The scalar product is often called a dot product because of the dot
notation used. It has a number of properties that we will exploit later:
(1) For any angle 0  ϕAB < π /2, the scalar product is positive. For angles above π/2 (π/2 < ϕAB  π), the scalar product
is negative.
(2) The scalar product is zero for any two perpendicular vectors (ϕAB ¼ π/2).
(3) For ϕAB ¼ 0 (parallel vectors), the scalar product equals AB, and for ϕAB ¼ π, the product is (–AB).
(4) The magnitude of the scalar product of two vectors is always smaller or equal to the product of their magnitudes
(jA·Bj  AB).
(5) The product can be viewed as the product of the magnitude of vector A and the magnitude of the projection of vector B
on A or vice versa (A·B ¼ A(BcosϕAB) ¼ B(AcosϕAB)).
(6) The scalar product is commutative and distributive:
AB ¼ B A ðÞ ð commutative 1:24Þ
Að Þ¼ B þ C AB þ A C ðÞ ð distributive 1:25Þ
The scalar product can be written explicitly using two vectors A and B in Cartesian coordinates as
AB ¼ ^x Ax þ ^y Ay þ ^z Az
  

^x Bx þ ^y By þ ^z Bz
 
¼ ^x  ^x AxBx þ ^x  ^y AxBy þ ^x  ^z AxBz þ ^y  ^x AyBx þ ^y  ^y AyBy þ ^y  ^z AyBz þ ^z  ^x AzBx þ ^z  ^y AzBy þ ^z  ^z AzBz
ð1:26Þ
From properties (2) and (3) and since unit vectors are of magnitude 1, we have
^x  ^y ¼ ^x ^z ¼ ^y  ^z ¼ ^y  ^x ¼ ^z  ^x ¼ ^z  ^y ¼ 0 ð1:27Þ
^x  ^x ¼ ^y  ^y ¼ ^z ^z ¼ 1 ð1:28Þ
Therefore, Eq. (1.26) becomes
AB ¼ AxBx þ AyBy þ AzBz ð1:29Þ
This form affords simple evaluation of the product from the components of the vectors rather than requiring
calculation of the angle between the vectors. From this, we also note that
A A ¼ AAcos 0ð Þ¼ A2 ¼ A2

C ¼ B – A. The scalar product C  C gives the distance C2
. This is the distance between P1 and P2 squared. Taking the
square root gives the required result:

1.3.2 The Vector Product
The vector product2 of two vectors A and B, denoted as A  B, is defined as
“the vector whose magnitude is the absolute value of the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors and the sine of
the smaller angle between the two vectors while the direction of the vector is perpendicular to the plane in which the
two vectors lie”;
that is,
A  B   n^ ABsinϕAB j j ð1:31Þ
where n^ is the unit vector normal to the plane formed by vectors A and B and ϕAB is, again, the smaller angle between the
vectors. The normal unit vector gives the direction of the product, which is obviously a vector. For this reason, it is called a
vector product or a cross product because of the cross symbol used in the notation.

2 The vector product was defined by Sir William Rowan Hamilton (1805–1865) as part of his theory of quaternions around 1845. James Clerk
Maxwell made use of this theory when he wrote his Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism in 1873, although he was critical of quaternions.
Modern electromagnetics uses the Heaviside–Gibbs vector system rather than the Hamilton system.
1.3 Products of Vectors 13
The unit vector may be in either direction perpendicular to the plane, and to define it uniquely, we employ the right-hand
rule, as shown in Figure 1.14. According to this rule, if the right-hand palm is placed on the first vector in the product and
rotated toward the second vector through an angle ϕAB, the extended thumb shows the correct direction of the cross product.
This rule immediately indicates that moving the palm from vector B to vector A gives a direction opposite to that moving
from vector A to B. Thus, we conclude that the vector product is not commutative:
A  B ¼ B  A ðÞ ð noncommutative 1:32Þ
In addition to the noncommutative property of the vector product, the following properties are noted:
(1) The vector product is always perpendicular to the plane of the two vectors; that is, it is perpendicular to both vectors.
(2) For two vectors which are perpendicular to each other (ϕAB ¼ π/2), the magnitude of the vector product is equal to the
product of the magnitudes of the two vectors (sinϕAB ¼ 1) and is always positive.
(3) The vector product of two parallel vectors is always zero (sinϕAB ¼ 0).
(4) The vector product of a vector with itself is always zero (sinϕAA ¼ 0).
(5) The vector product is not associative (this will be discussed in the following section because it requires the definition of a
triple product).
(6) The vector product is distributive:
A  ð Þ¼ B þ C A  B þ A  C ð1:33Þ
(7) The magnitude of the vector product represents the area bounded by the parallelogram formed by the two vectors and
two lines parallel to the vectors, as shown in Figure 1.15.
Evaluation of the vector product is performed similarly to that for the scalar product: We write the product explicitly and
expand the expression based on Eq. (1.33). Using two general vectors A and B in Cartesian coordinates, we get
A  B ¼ ^x Ax þ ^y Ay þ ^z Az

^x Bx þ ^y By þ ^z Bz

Because the unit vectors ^x , ^y , ^z are perpendicular to each other, and using the right-hand rule in Figure 1.14, we can write
^x  ^x ¼ ^y  ^y ¼ ^z  ^z ¼ 0 ð1:35Þ
from property 4 above. Similarly, using property 2 and the right-hand rule, we can write
^x  ^y ¼ ^z , ^y  ^z ¼ ^x , ^z  ^x ¼ ^y ,
^y  ^x ¼ ^z , ^z  ^y ¼ ^x , ^x  ^z ¼ ^y ð1:36Þ
Substitution of these products and rearranging terms gives
A  B ¼ ^x AyBz  AzBy
   þ ^y ð Þþ AzBx  AxBz ^z AxBy  AyBx
   ð1:37Þ
This is a rather straightforward operation, although lengthy. To avoid having to go through this process every time we use
the vector product, we note that the expression in Eq. (1.37) has the form of the determinant of a 3  3 matrix:

In the system of coordinates used here (right-hand Cartesian coordinates), the vector product is cyclic; that is, the
products in Eq. (1.36) are cyclical, as shown in Figure 1.16. This is a simple way to generate the signs of the components of
the cross product: a cross product performed in the sequence shown by the arrows in Figure 1.16a is positive; if it is in the
opposite sequence (Figure 1.16b), it is negative.
The vector product is used for a number of important operations. They include finding the direction of the vector product,
calculation of areas, evaluation of normal unit vectors, and representation of fields.
Example 1.7 Application: Vector Normal to a Plane
(a) Find a vector normal to a plane that contains points P1(0,1,0), P2(1,0,1), and P3(0,0,1).
(b) Find the normal unit vector.
Solution: This is a common use for the vector product. Because the vector product of two vectors is normal to both vectors,
we must first find two vectors that lie in the plane. Their vector product gives the normal vector. Calculation of the normal
unit vector can be done either using the definition of the unit vector in Eq. (1.2) or through the use of the scalar and vector
products.
Two vectors in the plane can be defined using any two pairs of points. Using P1 and P2, we define a vector (from P1 to P2) as
A ¼ ^x ð Þþ x2  x1 ^y

y2  y1

The unit vector can be found from Eq. (1.2) or from the definition of the vector product in Eq. (1.31). We use the latter as
an example of an alternative method:

The angle ϕAB can be most easily calculated from the scalar product in Eq. (1.23) as

C and A (or between C and B) must also be in the plane of A and B.
Example 1.8 Application: Area of a Triangle Find the area of the triangle with vertices at three general points P1(x1,
y1, z1), P2(x2,y2,z2), and P3(x3,y3,z3) (Figure 1.17a).
Solution: In this case, the vector nature of the vector product is irrelevant, but the magnitude of the vector product in
Eq. (1.31) is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the two vectors. This can be seen from the fact that the
magnitude of A  B is A(BsinϕAB). This is the area of rectangle abb0
c0 in Figure 1.17b. Since triangles acc0 and bdb0 are
identical, this is also the area of parallelogram abdc. Since triangles abc and cbd are identical, the area of abc is equal to half
the area of abdc. Calculation of the area of triangle abc is done by calculating the magnitude of the cross product of two of
the vectors forming the sides of the triangle and dividing by 2:

Example 1.10 The general equation of a plane in Cartesian coordinates is ax + by + cx + d ¼ 0. The equation of
the plane may be found as f(x,y,z) ¼ n  C ¼ 0 where n is the normal vector to the plane and C is a general vector in
the plane.
(a) Given three points P1(1,0,2), P2(3,1,–2), P3(2,3,2) in a plane, find the equation of the plane.
(b) Show that the equation of the plane may be written as
f xð Þ¼ ; y;z nxð Þþ x  x0 ny y  y0 ð Þþ nzð Þ¼ z  z0 0
where nx, ny, and nz are the scalar components of the normal unit vector to the plane and (x0,y0,z0) are the
coordinates of a point in the plane.
Solution: The three points given define two vectors (say P1 to P2 and P1 to P3). The normal to the plane is obtained through
use of the vector product. The vector A is then defined between a general point (x,y,z) and any of the points given. The form
in (b) is found from (a):
(a) Two vectors necessary to calculate the normal vector to the plane are
P1 to P2: A ¼ ^x ð Þþ 3  1 ^y ð Þþ 1  0 ^z ð Þ¼ 2  2 ^x 2 þ ^y 1  ^z 4
P1 to P3: B ¼ ^x ð Þþ 2  1 ^y ð Þþ 3  0 ^z ð Þ¼ 2  2 ^x 1 þ ^y 3
These two vectors are in the plane. Therefore, the normal vector to the plane may be written as:
n ¼ A  B ¼ ð Þ ^x 2 þ ^y 1  ^z 4 ð Þ¼ ^x 1 þ ^y 3 ^x 12  ^y 4 þ ^z 5
A general vector in the plane may be written as:
C ¼ ^x ð Þþ x  1 ^y ð Þþ y  0 ^z ð Þ z  2
where point P1 was used, arbitrarily.
The equation of the plane is
f xð Þ¼ ; y;z n C ¼ ð Þ ^x 12  ^y 4 þ ^z 5 ð Þ¼ ^x ð Þþ x  1 ^y ð Þþ y  0 ^z ð Þ z  2 0
or
f xð Þ¼ ; y;z 12ð Þ x  1 4ð Þþ y  0 5ð Þ¼ z  2 12x  4y þ 5z  22 ¼ 0

f xð Þ¼ ; y;z 12ð Þ x  2 4ð Þþ y  3 5ð Þ¼ z  2 12x  4y þ 5z  22 ¼ 0
This is the same as the result obtained in (a).
The formula in (b) is called the scalar equation of the plane whereas the form f(x,y,z) ¼ n  C ¼ 0 is referred to as the
vector equation of the plane.
1.3.3 Multiple Vector and Scalar Products
As with sums of vectors, we can define multiple products by repeatedly applying the rules of the scalar or vector product of
two vectors. However, because of the particular method of defining the vector and scalar products, not all combinations of
products are meaningful. For example, the result of a vector product is a vector, and therefore, it can only be obtained by
